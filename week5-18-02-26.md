# Week 5

## News

### Swift NIO
This week, Apple released [Swift NIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio) at the [try! Swift](https://www.tryswift.co/events/2018/tokyo/en/) Conference in Tokyo. Apple describes NIO as "a cross-platform asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients." For all you droplets that have been following Vapor 3 development, that means NIO will be replacing a significant portion of the code supporting Vapor behind the scenes. To quote [Tanner](https://github.com/tanner0101),

> Swift NIO directly replaces:
> - vapor/async (except we will keep our conveniences here, since they are nicer IMO)
> - vapor/sockets (we only supported TCP, they support TCP, UDP, Unix, way better!)
> - vapor/tls (finally, :pray:)
> - vapor/engine (except websockets and our multipart/form-url stuff. we will also port over our conveniences for header names, body, etc)

Vapor will take a performance hit until NIO's HTTP parser can be optimized, but the long-term benefits greatly outweigh the short-term drawbacks. Having a dedicated team at Apple working on all of the low level code leaves the Vapor team free to make large user-facing improvements with all that time previously spent mucking around with libraries that are being deprecated! 

This raises the question as to whether or not Vapor Nation should cover updates to NIO. What do you think? Drop your opinion in [#vapor-nation](https://vapor.team/) on Slack, or [@VaporNationNews](https://twitter.com/VaporNationNews) on Twitter!

### Swift By Sundell Featuring Tanner
[Swift By Sundell](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/) is a Swift podcast hosted by [@JohnSundell](https://github.com/JohnSundell). This week's guest is [@tanner0101](https://github.com/tanner0101), founder of Vapor. John is accepting questions right now, so get them in soon!

## New Features

### RSA Encription Implemented and Made Available To JWT
```swift
// create public and private key (only public required for verification)
let privateKey: Data = ...
let publicKey: Data = ...
let privateSigner = JWTSigner.rs256(key: .private2048(privateKey))
let publicSigner = JWTSigner.rs256(key: .public2048(publicKey))

// serialize jwt (requires private key)
let payload: TestPayload = ...
var jwt = JWT(payload: payload)
_ = try jwt.sign(using: publicSigner) // throws, can't sign w/ public signer
let data = try jwt.sign(using: privateSigner)

// parse jwt (public and private key work)
let parsed = try JWT<TestPayload>(from: data, verifiedUsing: publicSigner)
let parsed2 = try JWT<TestPayload>(from: data, verifiedUsing: privateSigner) // also works
print(parsed.payload)
print(parsed2.payload)
```

[vapor/crypto#39](https://github.com/vapor/crypto/pull/39)

### Support For `NULL` In MySQL
Adds support for `NULL` values when fetching data.

[vapor/mysql#133](https://github.com/vapor/mysql/pull/133)

### Added Support For Default Values In PostgreSQL
You can now set default values to be saved to the database for optional properties. The defaults will be used when such properties are `nil` during saving.
<!-- Needs a usage snippet --->

[vapor/fluent-postgresql#19](https://github.com/vapor/fluent-postgresql/pull/19)

### Foundation Client
Adds a `FoundationClient` class which implements the `Client` protocol using `URLSession`. This provides a more configurable (but less performant) alternative to `EngineClient`.

#### Create a single `FoundationClient`
```swift
let client = try req.make(FoundationClient.self)
```

#### Or prefer `FoundationClient` globally
```swift
var config = Config.default()
config.prefer(FoundationClient.self, for: Client.self)
let app = try Application(config: config)
let client = try app.make(Client.self)
print(client is FoundationClient) // true
```

#### Use just like `EngineClient`
```swift
let res = try client.send(.get, to: "http://vapor.codes")
debugPrint(res)
```

## Community Contributions

### Made `Router.on()` Public
[@calebkleveter](https://github.com/calebkleveter) opened up the `Router.on(:at:use:)` method for public use, allowing the HTTP method for newly registered routes to be specified as a parameter for routes that automaticly decode the request's body, along with those that don't.

[vapor/vapor#1528](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/pull/1528)

### Added Support For `BIT` and `TIMESTAMP` Types In MySQL
[@PitchLabsAsh](https://github.com/PitchLabsAsh) added support to `vapor/mysql` for the `BIT` and `TIMESTAMP` types. Vapor already had support for `DATETIME`, which [differs slightly from `TIMESTAMP`].(https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/datetime.html)

[vapor/mysql#131](https://github.com/vapor/mysql/pull/131)

### Add Typealias For UserIDKey
[@0xTim](https://github.com/0xTim) removed some boilerplate by `typealias`ing `WritableKeyPath<Self, UserType.ID>` to `UserIDKey`

[vapor/auth#25](https://github.com/vapor/auth/pull/25)

## Made For Vapor

### Vapor Test Tools
[@rafiki270](https://github.com/rafiki270) says he has "long struggled with testing so I have decided to publish my library of testing helpers as an SPM framework"

## Microtutorial
HTTP requests have held the Internet together for tens of years, but they do have limitations. Some of those limitations have been addressed by [HTTP/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2), but not quite all. Among those limitations is that the a server must wait for a client to send a request before it can send data to that client. It makes sense that the protocol is designed in this way, and I'd hate to be getting spammed by random servers all day. However, there are many cases where the server wants to be able to push additional data to the client on-demand after a connection has been established, and plain HTTP can't do that. That means if you want to run a server for something like, say, an instant messaging chat, the client must to continuously poll the server to check for new messages. This places a heavy load on both client and server, wasting a lot of time and data.

[Websockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) solve this problem by leaving established HTTP connections open and converting them to specially formatted binary data streams. This allows the server and client to exchange information as needed, an ideal solution for realtime applications such as chatting, videoconferencing, and more. The best news of all is, Vapor supports them out of the box!

```swift
router.websocket("echo") { (req, ws) in
    ws.onString({ (ws, msg) in
        ws.send(string: msg)
    })
}
```

This example sets up a websocket route on `ws://localhost:8080/echo`. Any data sent to that connection will echoed right back.
