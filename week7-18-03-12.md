# Week 7 & 8

## News
RC2 was tagged for all packages last week, and with it, NIO is now handles all all non-blocking async for Vapor! 🎉🎉🎉 If you want to know more about the impact of NIO, check out Tanner on Swift by Sundell and Week 5 of Vapor Nation. Many [API docs](https://api.vapor.codes) were also released this week. API docs are less like the tutorial style you'd find at [docs.vapor.codes](https://docs.vapor.codes) and more like traditional docs you'd find for other libraries and frameworks.

## New Features

### Adds Ability To Execute Shell Commands
adds a new Process.execute method for executing shell commands.

```swift
let result = try Process.execute("echo", "hi")
print(result) /// "hi"
```

[vapor/core#100](https://github.com/vapor/core/pull/100)

### Simplify The Services System
Simplifies the service system and internal caching.

[vapor/service#18](https://github.com/vapor/service/pull/18)

### Use foundation base64 + async deprecations
* use foundation for base64 coding
* adds escape/unescape methods for base64 strings and data

[vapor/core#103](https://github.com/vapor/core/pull/103)

### MySQL Query Pipelining
MySQL now supports multiple queries being enqueued when one is still running

[vapor/mysql#145](https://github.com/vapor/mysql/pull/145)  
[vapor/fluent#411](https://github.com/vapor/fluent/issues/411)  
[vapor/fluent#413](https://github.com/vapor/fluent/pull/413)

### New SQL Query Operators

[vapor/fluent#423](https://github.com/vapor/fluent/pull/423)  
[vapor/fluent#424](https://github.com/vapor/fluent/pull/424)

### Adds Command To Revert Migrations

[vapor/fluent#421](https://github.com/vapor/fluent/pull/421)

### Use Environment For Command Line Arguments
* move to using the `Environment.commandLine` property for accessing CLI arguments. An improvement over using a statically available property that could create issues for projects with multiple applications.
* Adds `runningServer` property.
* Adds `asyncBoot` and `asyncRun` methods to Application

[vapor/vapor#1570](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/pull/1570)

### Services and Database Connections Are Now Extendable
`Extendable` is a protocol which allows you to store data on instances of the protocol.
`DatabaseConnection` and `Service` are now `Extendable`. This will allow higher-level libraries to store things on a connection without resorting to global caches which may leak memory.

[vapor/service#19](https://github.com/vapor/service/pull/19)
[vapor/database-kit#19](https://github.com/vapor/database-kit/pull/19)

### Decoding Errors Result In 400 Response

[vapor/vapor#1563](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/pull/1563)

## NIO

### HTTP Pipelining
[HTTP pipelining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_pipelining) is a relatively new technique that's only supported by a couple browsers at the present, but it has huge potential for performance gains. You can find the [benchmarks](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/pull/62#issuecomment-372657330) yielding around 3x performance gains in a comment a ways down the thread.

[apple/swift-nio#62](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/pull/62)

### Discussion On Performance Improvements For HTTP
Vapor lost some performance when it switched to NIO, but optimizing NIO's HTTP parser should improve that by a lot.

[apple/swift-nio#141](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/issues/141)

### Discussion On `flatMap` vs `then` For Future Interaction
`flatMap` comes from the functional programming world and is more technically correct, but `then` is more consistent with other promise/future implimentations. What do you think?

### Default Postgres Port to 5432 When Not Supplied
[@0xTim](https://github.com/0xTim) simplified PSQL config by defaulting to the port most setups of PSQL will be using.

[vapor/postgresql#34](https://github.com/vapor/postgresql/pull/34)

### Fix a memory leak in `PostgreSQLConnection`
[@MrMage](https://github.com/MrMage) - 
>PostgreSQLTableNameCache holds a PostgreSQLConnection future. Once that future is fulfilled, it strongly holds a reference to PostgreSQLConnection. That connection in turn holds the table name cache, so we have a reference cycle. This causes the table name cache and its connection to never get released. This is relevant when testing, if the tests are set up such that each test creates a new Database.
